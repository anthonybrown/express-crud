# Express app

This application performs basic CRUD functions and stores data to a mongoDB
database;

Hopefully you will have Nodejs and express installed on your local machine to run.
if not get your [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) or use `brew install node --without npm`
then install npm with this script: `curl https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`

You need [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed

We also need [Express](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable) installed, follow the link and
the directions to install express from the CLI

Once all of the software is installed, download or clone this package and cd into `express-crud`

open another terminal and start up mongo with `mongod`, in your first terminal, you should be inside `express-crud`
do `npm start`. Go to localhost:3000 and you can start adding employee's to the database.

I will try and get it on Heroku or appfog as well.

Thanks for stopping by.
